# Complete List of IATA Airports with Details
An up to date CSV dump of the [Travelhackingtool.com](https://www.travelhackingtool.com) airport database with basic information about every IATA airport and city code in the world. The IATA codes had been used as a primary value. Each entry contains IATA code, ICAO code, Timezone, name, city code, two-letter ISO country code, URL, elevation above sea level in feet, latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, geo encoded city, county and state.

## Maintenance

This database is maintained by its author [Alexander Bilz](https://github.com/lxndrblz). Please open an issue/pull request if I had missed an airport or if the information is incorrect.
